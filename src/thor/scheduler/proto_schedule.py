    interval is expected to be a string, as one of the following:
    @hourly, @daily, @weekly, @monthly, @yearly. 
    Will execute at the same time each hour/day/week/month/year.

    hour preserves minutes, day preserves h/m, week preserves weekday/h/m, 
    monthly preserves day-of-month and h/m, yearly preserves date and h/m. 

    TODO: Add biweekly / thor-centric option to fit needs. 

    Additional Notes:
    Relies on schedule_job_cron. Only builds the cron string in-house. 
    Possible sources of bugs / misinterpretations:
        If a job date is specified that is more than 1 period from 
        the current date, cron will execute the job in the next period
        as well as in the one thereafter, earlier than expected. 
        e.g.
            Today is Wednesday, and a weekly job is scheduled with 
            a start date of the Friday after next. 
            This method will unintuitively cause cron to run the job
            on this Friday as well as next Friday, potentially breaking things. 
                For concreteness:
                Today (Wed) is 09/08/21, Friday is 09/10/21. 
                The desired start date is 09/17/21, but cron will 
                run the job on 09/10/21 as well as 09/17/21. 
        Fixing this would involve a moderate amount of circumlocution. 
        Likely would involve calling an external job to build the weekly job 
        just before it starts, instead of immediately as is done here. 
                To follow the concrete example, a job would be called 
                next Thursday (09/16/21), causing the weekly jobs to be 
                scheduled for 09/17/21 and thereafter.
