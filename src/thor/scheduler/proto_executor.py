# proto_executor.py

# Provides sample methods for proto_schedule to
# work with and call.
# Will try to execute python read/write to sample files.

# Cygwin notes:
# "python" call works just fine with either full name (/usr/bin/python)
# or just "python". However, as crontab works from root, full name of
# the thor directory (seen here in save_path for my machine) needs to
# be specified.

# !!! NOTE:
# depending on how you are running this, as well as your directory structure.
# This should eventually be passed in via environment variable,
