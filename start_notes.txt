Notes on first-time configuration - results may vary

This was done on an unmodified machine with nothing installed. 
Due to changes in the codebase, these steps may not work exactly, 
but they are preserved for troubleshooting posterity. 

Installed Homebrew. 
Installed XCode Tools (likely unnecessary)
Used Homebrew to start postgres (brew services start postgresql)
Created database (createdb)
Install modules in Poetry (poetry install)
Add __init__.py file to make it a package?
Edit thor.env to use appropriate username - no postgres default user exists, so I use my own
Run create_all_tables from top-level /thor - manually edit PYTHONPATH (PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:./src/ poetry run python src/thor/create_all_tables.py)
Manually editing PYTHONPATH as before, standup FastAPI with Gunicorn (PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:./src/ poetry run gunicorn thor.main:app -b 0.0.0.0:6565 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --reload)

Instead of using PYTHONPATH, can instead use PYTHONPATH=./src/
