# Overview

this new tool should help us achieve a fully-automated hands-free Gen3 release. We need to eliminate “toil” from our day-to-day tasks so we can focus on project-specific tasks, maintenance of our CI/CD pipelines, expansion of the Gen3-QA framework, test coverage and innovation.

Manual and repetitive work is boring and error-prone, as software engineers, we can do better than this.


# Features

This new tool (THOR) has the following features:
* RESTful API to start the release flow and track the status of each step
* Coordinate each and every step of the Gen3 Release by working with:
  * The Jenkins API (kicking off Jenkins jobs and tracking its results)
  * Executing gen3-release-utils scripts & the gen3release-sdk CLI
  * Interacting with JIRA and Slack APIs
* Provide FULL transparency to the Gen3 Release process through a friendly GUI that should help any Project Manager (PM) observe the progress of the releases throughout the environments they own.
* Facilitate parameterization of our release automation and make it more flexible (e.g., change cadence / time-frame between releases).

# How to run Thor

## Create the database

```
psql -U postgres -c "create database thor_test_tmp"
```

## Create tables and test data

```
poetry run python src/thor/create_all_tables.py
```

You should see something like:

```
% psql -U postgres
psql (13.3)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# \c thor_test_tmp;
You are now connected to database "thor_test_tmp" as user "postgres".
thor_test_tmp=# \dt;
          List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  |  Owner
--------+----------+-------+----------
 public | releases | table | postgres
 public | tasks    | table | postgres

thor_test_tmp=# select * from releases;
 id | version |   result
----+---------+-------------
  3 | 2021.09 | In Progress
  4 | 2021.07 | Completed
(2 rows)
```

## How to test

```
poetry run pytest -vv -s tests
```

## Start the FastAPI web server

```
poetry run gunicorn thor.main:app -b 0.0.0.0:6565 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --reload
```

## Time travel

```
LD_PRELOAD=/libfaketime/src/libfaketime.so.1 FAKETIME="-15d" poetry run gunicorn thor.main:app -b 0.0.0.0:6565 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --reload
```
or
```
LD_PRELOAD=/libfaketime/src/libfaketime.so.1 FAKETIME="@2020-12-24 20:30:00" poetry run gunicorn thor.main:app -b 0.0.0.0:6565 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --reload
```

# Local development with Docker

## ## Launch the containers

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Create the database

```
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c "create database thor_test_tmp"
```

## Create tables and test data

```
docker exec -it thor /env/bin/python src/thor/create_all_tables.py
```

Thor API is then available at http://localhost:8001
